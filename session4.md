# Integral Transforms

This session teaches you how to apply the discrete Fourier transform to perform spectral analysis and filtering on data sets. The topic is generalized to introduce the continuous Fourier and Laplace transform.  

\learning{
**By the end of this lesson you have**
- learned how to apply the discrete Fourier transform to compute the amplitude and phase spectrum
- learned how to apply the discrete Fourier transform to compute the power spectrum
- learned how to filter data in the spectral domain
- reviewed important properties of the continuous and Fourier and Laplace transform
