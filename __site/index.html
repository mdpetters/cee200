<p>Students are encouraged to take an active role as their own advocates. They are not required to identify themselves as having a disability; however, students are not eligible for accommodations unless they self-identify. Students are responsible for visiting the SDRC office &#40;Student Disability Resource Center, 125 Costo Hall &#40;951&#41; 827-4538, <a href="http://sdrc.ucr.edu/">http://sdrc.ucr.edu/</a>, and obtaining and delivering letters detailing appropriate accommodations to each of their instructors in a timely manner every quarter. </p>
<p>Instructors are responsible for assisting in providing accommodations; students are required to make requests in an appropriate and timely manner. Ordinarily, required accommodations are described in a letter, which is given to the instructor by the student. Classroom accommodations may involve providing space for a sign language interpreter or real-time captionist, asking students to clear a path for wheelchair users, announcing need for note takers, for example. Some accommodations, such as materials in Braille, large print, or electronic format, readers, and special equipment for testing or composing papers, are provided outside of the classroom by SDRC.</p>
