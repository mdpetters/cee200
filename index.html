Grading policies follow <a href="https://senate.ucr.edu/regulations/section/513/01">UCR Regulations</a>., Letter grades are defined as follows:</p> <p><strong>A - Distinction, indicating exceptional achievement.</strong> Mastery of course content at the highest level of attainment that can reasonably be expected of students at a given stage of development.</p> <p><strong>B - High pass, indicating more than minimal competence but less than exceptional achievement.</strong> Strong performance demonstrating a high level of attainment for a student at a given stage of development.</p> <p><strong>C - Pass, indicating competence.</strong> Totally acceptable performance demonstrating an adequate level of attainment for a student at a given stage of development.</p> <p><strong>D - Marginal pass.</strong> This grade is used to recognize that a student‚Äôs performance was marginal but clearly better than that of students who receive an F.</p> <p><strong>F - Fail.</strong> This grade is used to indicate that the student has failed the course and will not receive any credit for the course. The F grade indicates that the student‚Äôs performance in the required exercises has revealed almost no understanding of the course content.</p> <p><strong>I - Incomplete.</strong> This grade is used as a temporary grade. At the discretion of the instructor, students may be given an GD grade for work not completed because of a serious interruption in their work not caused by the student‚Äôs negligence.</p> <p><strong>W - Withdrawal.</strong> Used on student‚Äôs grade reports and transcripts to indicate all courses for which they have received official approval to drop or from which they have received official approval to withdraw after the deadlines for dropping.</p> <p><strong>Mastery Based Grading</strong></p> <p>This course will use mastery-based grading.

An extension may be granted if the student can document extenuating circumstances related to an extensive period of excused absence between the date that the homework assigned and the homework due date. In addition, <em>religious observances</em> or other <em>unanticipated life events</em> may interfere with class attendance and homework submission.
