#### Course Materials
Students will need access to a laptop computer with scientific computing software installed. The choice of software is up to the student and may be one of the following: Matlab, Python, R, or Julia. Students need to be able to run git from the command line and be able to install add-on packages on their device. The computer will be needed to exams


#### Key Learning Outcomes

\outcomes{
*At the end of the term, participants will be able to write computer programs*
1. to perform symbolic computations
2. to perform matrix-based regression and inversion problems on data
3. to perform spectral analysis on data sets
4. to solve ordinary differential equations using ODE solvers
5. to solve partial differential equations using finite element methods
}

#### Assessment
Assessment of learning objectives will be through homework assignments and frequent exams. The homework assignments will require students to demonstrate that they are able to write the computer programs to perform the tasks taught in class.  


#### Evaluation of Student Performance

**The grade components in the class include:**

| Component | Weight | Details |
| ----------|--------|---------|
| Homework      | 20% | Homework will be collected via GitHub Classroom. |
| Midterm Exams | 40% | Two midterm exams are scheduled.  |
| Final Exam    | 40% | The final exam is cumulative. |

Exams will mimic the homework assignments and be assigned via GitHub Classroom.

**Curve Policy:**

Students who with a documented excuse that are unable to take the test at those times will schedule an alternate time to take the quiz with the instructor. I reserve the right to assign grades using a curve, should the class average be lower than expected.

*However, if I were to apply a curve, I would never reduce your grade. If you earned an 95/100 without a curve, you earned at minimum an A.*

In case I apply a curve, I take all of the total scores for the class and make a grade distribution. I then compute the average and standard deviation of the distribution. The mean score corresponds to a B- in the course. I then assign the rest of the grades by looking at both the standard deviation around the mean and by looking for natural breaks. The important question is how do I assign A's and D’s and F's? An A grade means someone has demonstrated superior knowledge of the course material. Hence, I only assign an A grade to students who have mastered of course content at the highest level that can reasonably be expected. For students that are on the cusp, I will honor effort. If you come to class, ask questions, are engaged in class, and study the memorization questions you should not receive a D.

#### Methods of Student Instruction 
Lectures

#### Readings and Recommended Texts
Reading material is provided in the form of notebooks. Additional reading is assigned as needed.

#### Weekly Schedule

#### Academic Accommodations
Students are encouraged to take an active role as their own advocates. They are not required to identify themselves as having a disability; however, students are not eligible for accommodations unless they self-identify. Students are responsible for visiting the SDRC office (Student Disability Resource Center, 125 Costo Hall (951) 827-4538, [http://sdrc.ucr.edu/](http://sdrc.ucr.edu/), and obtaining and delivering letters detailing appropriate accommodations to each of their instructors in a timely manner every quarter. 

Instructors are responsible for assisting in providing accommodations; students are required to make requests in an appropriate and timely manner. Ordinarily, required accommodations are described in a letter, which is given to the instructor by the student. Classroom accommodations may involve providing space for a sign language interpreter or real-time captionist, asking students to clear a path for wheelchair users, announcing need for note takers, for example. Some accommodations, such as materials in Braille, large print, or electronic format, readers, and special equipment for testing or composing papers, are provided outside of the classroom by SDRC.

#### Academic Rights and Responsibilities
All students, faculty, and staff are responsible for understanding and complying with the University’s stated academic requirements.  Students should feel free to express their thoughts and opinions in an academic forum.  Assignments must be completed by the student for whom the work is assigned and without unauthorized aid of any kind.

#### Academic Integrity
At UCR we are committed to upholding and promoting the values of the Tartan Soul: Integrity, Accountability, Excellence, and Respect. As a student in this class, it is your responsibility to act in accordance with these values by completing all assignments in the manner described, and by informing the instructor of suspected acts of academic misconduct by your peers. By doing so, you will not only affirm your own integrity, but also the integrity of the intellectual work of this University, and the degree which it represents. Should you choose to commit academic misconduct in this class, you will be  held accountable according to the policies set forth by the University, and will incur appropriate consequences both in this class and from Student Conduct and Academic Integrity Programs.

Cheating is the giving, taking, or presenting of information or material by a student that unethically or fraudulently aids oneself or another person on any work which is to be considered in the determination of a grade or the completion of academic requirements or the enhancement of that student’s record or academic career. Cheating includes, but is not limited, to the following actions:

1. Copying from someone else’s assignment, examination, or other academic exercise;

2. Possessing, buying, selling, removing, receiving, or using, at any time or in any manner not prescribed by the faculty member, any information related to an instrument of academic evaluation;

3. Using materials, equipment, or assistance in connection with an assignment, examination, or other academic exercise which have not been authorized by the faculty member, including but not limited to, notes, calculator, or other technology;

4. Obtaining or attempting to obtain, in a dishonest manner, any material relating to a student’s academic work;

5. Working with another or others in completing an assignment, examination, or other academic exercise when the faculty member has required independent and unaided action;

6. Attempting to influence or change an academic evaluation, grade, or record by unfair means;

7. Permitting another individual to substitute for one’s self in an academic evaluation;

8. Marking or submitting an examination or evaluation material in a manner designed to deceive the grading system;

9. Failing to comply with a specific condition of academic integrity which has been clearly announced in a particular course;

10. Submitting, without prior permission of the faculty member, any work by a student which has at any time been submitted in identical or similar form by that student in fulfillment of any other academic requirement at any institution;

11. Submitting of material in whole or part for academic evaluation that has been prepared by another individual(s);

12. Submitting data which have been altered or contrived in such a way as to be deliberately misleading; or

13. Providing false information to the University in any manner to achieve an unfair advantage, enhance one’s record, or complete a requirement.
