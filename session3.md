# Regularization

Matrix based ordinary least squares regression is reviewed. Discretization of Fredholm and Voltarra integral equations is introduced. Matrix-based regularization approaches to solve ill-posed problems is discussed. 

\learning{
**By the end of this lesson you have learned**
- apply matrix based ordinary regression to find multi-linear regression parameters to fit data.
- discretize integral equations to cast them into matrix form.
- analyze matrices to determine the degree to which problems are ill posed.
- apply regularization to invert ill-posed matrix equations.
- apply common approaches to identify the optimal regularization parameter.
