**Definition of Letter Grades**

This Course uses Letter Grading: A+, A, A-, B+, B, B-, C+, C, C-, D+, D, D-, F, I, W. Grading policies follow [UCR Regulations](https://senate.ucr.edu/regulations/section/513/01)., Letter grades are defined as follows:

**A - Distinction, indicating exceptional achievement.** Mastery of course content at the highest level of attainment that can reasonably be expected of students at a given stage of development.

**B - High pass, indicating more than minimal competence but less than exceptional achievement.** Strong performance demonstrating a high level of attainment for a student at a given stage of development.

**C - Pass, indicating competence.** Totally acceptable performance demonstrating an adequate level of attainment for a student at a given stage of development.

**D - Marginal pass.** This grade is used to recognize that a student’s performance was marginal but clearly better than that of students who receive an F.

**F - Fail.** This grade is used to indicate that the student has failed the course and will not receive any credit for the course. The F grade indicates that the student’s performance in the required exercises has revealed almost no understanding of the course content.

**I - Incomplete.** This grade is used as a temporary grade. At the discretion of the instructor, students may be given an GD grade for work not completed because of a serious interruption in their work not caused by the student’s negligence.

**W - Withdrawal.** Used on student’s grade reports and transcripts to indicate all courses for which they have received official approval to drop or from which they have received official approval to withdraw after the deadlines for dropping.

**Mastery Based Grading**

This course will use mastery-based grading. Mastery based grading assigns letter grades "A" to "F" based on a point cutoff evaluated from the assignment rubric. 

\note{
Mastery based grading will never reduce your grade. If you earned an 95/100, you demonstrated mastery. The assignment difficulty is typically at a level that full credit can be achieved.
}

Under some circumstances I *may* allow resubmission of an assignment for you to demonstrate mastery. 

**Absence Policy**

Consistent class attendance is the number one predictor of academic success. Therefore, class attendance is required. Excused absences include
1. Medical Conditions
2. Death in the Immediate Family
3. Military Orders
4. Legal Obligations

Written verification from a from physician, lawyer, judge, or commanding officer needs to be provided for any makeup exam.

**Late Homework**

Late homework will receive no credit. An extension may be granted if the student can document extenuating circumstances related to an extensive period of excused absence between the date that the homework assigned and the homework due date. In addition, *religious observances* or other *unanticipated life events* may interfere with class attendance and homework submission. These *may* qualify for an extension, provided sufficient documentation is presented.

#### Methods of Student Instruction 
- Slides: Slide deck presentation are used to deliver boilerplate content
- Lecture Notes: Handwritten lecture notes are used to deliver key derivations
- GitHub Classroom: GitHub Classroom is used for homework projects 
- Pluto Notebooks: Pluto notebooks are used as reference text and demonstration of implementation of algorithms in computer language
- Discussion Sessions: Discussion sessions are used for one-on-one instruction 

#### Readings and Recommended Texts
Reading material is provided in the form of Pluto notebooks. Additional reading may be assigned on an ad-hoc basis.

#### Academic Accommodations
Students are encouraged to take an active role as their own advocates. They are not required to identify themselves as having a disability; however, students are not eligible for accommodations unless they self-identify. Students are responsible for visiting the SDRC office (Student Disability Resource Center, 125 Costo Hall (951) 827-4538, [http://sdrc.ucr.edu/](http://sdrc.ucr.edu/), and obtaining and delivering letters detailing appropriate accommodations to each of their instructors in a timely manner every quarter. 

Instructors are responsible for assisting in providing accommodations; students are required to make requests in an appropriate and timely manner. Ordinarily, required accommodations are described in a letter, which is given to the instructor by the student. Classroom accommodations may involve providing space for a sign language interpreter or real-time captionist, asking students to clear a path for wheelchair users, announcing need for note takers, for example. Some accommodations, such as materials in Braille, large print, or electronic format, readers, and special equipment for testing or composing papers, are provided outside of the classroom by SDRC. UCR [practices for students](https://studentdocs.ucr.edu/dos/uc-riverside_dean-of-studetns_practices-for-students-with-disabilities.pdf) summarized by the Dean.

#### Academic Rights and Responsibilities
All students, faculty, and staff are responsible for understanding and complying with the University’s stated academic requirements.  Students should feel free to express their thoughts and opinions in an academic forum.  Assignments must be completed by the student for whom the work is assigned and without unauthorized aid of any kind.

#### Academic Integrity
At UCR we are committed to upholding and promoting the values of the Tartan Soul: Integrity, Accountability, Excellence, and Respect. As a student in this class, it is your responsibility to act in accordance with these values by completing all assignments in the manner described, and by informing the instructor of suspected acts of academic misconduct by your peers. By doing so, you will not only affirm your own integrity, but also the integrity of the intellectual work of this University, and the degree which it represents. Should you choose to commit academic misconduct in this class, you will be  held accountable according to the policies set forth by the University, and will incur appropriate consequences both in this class and from Student Conduct and Academic Integrity Programs. For more information regarding University policy and its enforcement, please visit: [https://conduct.ucr.edu/](https://conduct.ucr.edu/).

The use of generative AI software such as ChatGPT or GitHub Copilot is expressly forbidden in this course. Use of these tools will be treated as academic misconduct.
}

Cheating is the giving, taking, or presenting of information or material by a student that unethically or fraudulently aids oneself or another person on any work which is to be considered in the determination of a grade or the completion of academic requirements or the enhancement of that student’s record or academic career. Cheating includes, but is not limited to the following actions:

1. Copying from someone else’s assignment, examination, or other academic exercise.
2. Possessing, buying, selling, removing, receiving, or using, at any time or in any manner not prescribed by the faculty member, any information related to an instrument of academic evaluation.

4. Obtaining or attempting to obtain, in a dishonest manner, any material relating to a student’s academic work.
5. Working with another or others in completing an assignment, examination, or other academic exercise when the faculty member has required independent and unaided action.
6. Attempting to influence or change an academic evaluation, grade, or record by unfair means.
7. Permitting another individual to substitute for one’s self in an academic evaluation.
8. Marking or submitting an examination or evaluation material in a manner designed to deceive the grading system.
9. Failing to comply with a specific condition of academic integrity which has been clearly announced in a particular course.
10. Submitting, without prior permission of the faculty member, any work by a student which has at any time been submitted in identical or similar form by that student in fulfillment of any other academic requirement at any institution.
11. Submitting of material in whole or part for academic evaluation that has been prepared by another individual(s).
12. Submitting data which have been altered or contrived in such a way as to be deliberately misleading. 
13. Providing false information to the University in any manner to achieve an unfair advantage, enhance one’s record, or complete a requirement.
